NAME
    Email::Stuff - Email stuff to people, and things, and stuff...

DESCRIPTION
    Note: Uploaded for review only, guarenteed to do nothing but compile.

    I REPEAT. MANY KNOWN BUGS. DO NOT USE!!!

    In the spirit of the rest of the Email:: modules, Email::Stuff is a
    relatively light package that wraps over Email::MIME::Creator to take
    one more layer of details away from the process of building and sending
    medium complexity emails from website and other automated processes.

    Email::Stuff is generally used to build emails from within a single
    function, so it contains no parsing support, and little modification
    support. To re-iterate, this is very much a module for those "slap it
    together and send it off" situations, but that still has enough grunt
    behind the scenes to do things properly.

METHODS
  new
    Creates a new, empty, Email::Stuff object.

  headers
    Returns as a list all of the headers currently set for the Email

  parts
    Returns as a list all of the Email::MIME parts for the Email

  header $header => $value
    Adds a single named header to the email

  To $address
    Adds a To header to the email

  From $address
    Adds (yes ADDS, just do it once) a From header to the email

  CC $address
    Adds a CC header to the email

  BCC $address
    Adds a BCC header to the email

  text_body $body [, $header => $value, ... ]
    Sets the text body of the email. Unless specified, all the appropriate
    headers are set for you. You may overload any as needed. See
    Email::MIME::Creator for the actual headers to use.

    Returns the actual Email::MIME part created as a convenience

  html_body $body [, $header => $value, ... ]
    Set the HTML body of the email. Unless specified, all the appropriate
    headers are set for you. You may overload any as needed. See
    Email::MIME::Creator for the actual headers to use.

    Returns the actual Email::MIME part created as a convenience

  attach $contents [, $header => $value, ... ]
    Adds an attachment to the email. The first argument is the file contents
    followed by (as for text_body and html_body) the list of headers to use.
    Email::Stuff should TRY to guess the headers right, but you may wish to
    provide them anyway to be sure. Encoding is Base64 by default.

    Returns the actual Email::MIME part created as a convenience

  Email
    Creates and returns the full Email::MIME object for the email.

  as_string
    Returns the string form of the email. Identical to (and uses behind the
    scenes) Email::MIME->as_string.

TO DO
    Finish the trickier auto-headers for attachments

    Test, test, test
